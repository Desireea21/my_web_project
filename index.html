		<p>Hello, my name is Desiree Aponte, I am a current Valencia College student pursuing an A.S. degree in Motion Graphics. I originally developed my love of the motion design world when I was in the graphic design program while taking the Drawing 101 course. As I began to research what motion design was, I discovered KJV Pictures on YouTube and was inspired by the animations created for the Christian community. As a Bible-believing Christian, I hope to also learn how I can use motion design to reach the lost and dying world and share Jesus with them in a unique way. Therefore, I decided to change to the motion design track. This program has enabled me to understand the process of editing and creating videos, pictures, branding systems, and animated logos. I continually look forward to learning and networking with fellow students and teachers!</p>
