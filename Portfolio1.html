	<h1>Portfolio</h1>
	<p>These are the projects I created in the DIG2000 class. I learned how to create Photoshop images, Premiere Pro videos, and a website with HTML</p>

<div class="section">
<p1>The Sparrow</p1> </div>
	<h5>This is my photoshop project where I learned to edit images non-destructively. I also learned how to work with masking layers which was very helpful to avoid destructive editing. I wanted to combine images that reflected Luke 12:7 and I think having images with birds, flowers, and the cross helped me to accomplish my vision for this project.</h5>

	<div class="section"><p1>Seven Layers of Jenga</p1></div>
	<h5>This is my stop motion animation, where I took 194 photos and animated them. I love the game Jenga and thought it would be fun to create the stop motion project building seven layers of the blocks. I took pictures each time I moved the Jenga blocks, and I am pleased with the outcome.</h5>

<div class="section"><p1>The Cake Assembly</p1></div>
<h5>This is my video editing project where I learned how to use Premiere Pro video editor. I wanted the video to represent the early days of spring and what a great way to enter spring with some baking. I made the cake, filling, and meringue for the video and used it to assemble the cake. The story for the cake is also based on the stacking of the cake featuring a girl named Emma. I learned a lot from this project, and I look forward to creating and editing more videos in the future.</h5>
